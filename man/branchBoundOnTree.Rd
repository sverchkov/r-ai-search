\title{Branch and bound on a search tree}
\usage{
branchBoundOnTree(init.node, getCostBounds, getChildren, isGoal)
}
\arguments{
\item{init.node}{Initial node of the search space}

\item{getCostBounds}{Function that returns the upper and lower bounds of the cost
given a node}

\item{getChildren}{Function that gets the children of the current node in the search
tree}

\item{isGoal}{Function that determines whether a node is a goal node}
}
\value{
an optimal goal node
}
\description{
This function assumes that the search space is a tree, meaning that it does not
check whether it is revisiting a node.
}
\details{
We use the typical convention of the score representing a cost, meaning that lower
scores are better, and the optimum is a minimum.
